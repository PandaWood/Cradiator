Installation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming that Team City is installed in the directory $TEAMCITY_HOME:

  1. Ensure your TeamCity server has the Guest account enabled
  2. Copy the cradiator.jar file into the directory $TEAMCITY_HOME/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib/.
  3. Restart the Team City server. 
  
Point your Cradiator configuration at the following URL:

    http://<teamcity-server>:<port>/guestAuth/cradiator.html?projectId=<projectid>

E.g. if the server is running on localhost, port 8111 and the project "Test" has a project id of "project2" then use:
    
    http://localhost:8111/guestAuth/cradiator.html?projectId=project2

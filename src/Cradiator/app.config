<!--
  
* Polling Frequency - In seconds. Default is 30   
  
* URL - The base CruiseControl XML status report URL
  - eg for CCNet - http://ccnetlive.thoughtworks.com/ccnet/XmlStatusReport.aspx
  - eg for Java  - http://www.spice-3d.org/cruise/xml
  - eg for Ruby (.rb) http://cruisecontrolrb.thoughtworks.com/XmlStatusReport.aspx
		(If URL ends with 'ccnet' "XmlStatusReport.aspx" will be auto-appended)
  ** DEBUG MODE - prepend the URL with the word 'debug' - this switches to using an xml file in the bin folder 
	 named 'DummyProjectStatus.xml' instead of connecting to the Cruise WebService - useful for testing /screenshots etc
  
* ProjectNameRegEx - RegEx used to filter which projects are included (by name)
	- Defaults to ".*" (even if config = "")
	
* CategoryRegEx - as for ProjectNameRegEx but filters by category name
  
* Skin - Currently 3 choices 
  (1) Grid - arranged in a grid format
  (2) Stack - arranged in a stack (ie top-to-bottom listbox type) format
  (3) StackPhoto - same as stack but shows an image of the build breaker and only one breaker in text 
	    (the last listed - which is the last person to commit while build is broken)
	 ** The photo/image functionality, requires a sub-folder named 'images' (relative to folder in which
	    exe resides) with a .jpg file for each username. This folder is auto-created by the installer.
	    The jpeg file must be named using the cc username eg bsimpson requires a file 'images/bsimpson.jpg'
	    If a file/photo does not exist for a user, everything will still work as normal (ie it's not considered an error)
  
* ShowCountdown - 'true' or 'false' (case insensitive) ,so { True False TRUE FALSE } are all valid
	Shows a clock that counts down the 'time to go' before refreshing the screen (updated approx every second)
  
* PlaySounds - true/false, whether to play sounds on events (described below) (.WAV files only)
* PlaySpeech - true/false, whether to speak (ie use SpeechSynthesizer) on certain build events - is configurable (see below)  

* BrokenBuildSound - the filename (without path) of the .WAV file
	The file is assumed to be in a sub-folder named 'sounds' (relative to the folder in which exe resides) 
	Plays in response to a particular project that is not Broken (FAILURE|EXCEPTION) followed by being Broken  
  
* FixedBuildSound - as for BrokenBuildSound, but plays in the case of Broken (FAILURE|EXCEPTION) followed by SUCCESS

* BrokenBuildText - text can be simple or include 'variables' which are replaced at runtime
	Simple  - Voice automatically speaks the project name, followed by configured text 
			      eg speaks "Project1 [your text goes here]." 
			    - default vavlue is "is broken"
	Complex - Can include 2 variables in your text (1) $ProjectName$ (2) $Breaker$ (only for broken builds)) 
			      to specify variables that are known only at run time, for that particular project 
			      eg "$ProjectName$ is broken, $Breaker$, you're fired!"
			  
* FixedBuildText - as for BrokenBuildText - default value is "is fixed"

* usernames - a section for mapping usernames to real or full-length names for use by the SpeechSynthesizer 
			        (specifically, used when figuring the $Breaker$ variable in Fixed/BrokenBuildText)
					
* BreakerGuiltStrategy - 'First' or 'Last'. How to determine the 'Breaker', is the 'First' build breaker always guilty?, 
						   or do subsequent committers ('Last' breaker) assume guilt when they commit over a breaking build?
